# Setup Instructions for Firebase Integration

## ✅ What We Just Did

### 1. Secured Your Firebase API Key
- Created `.env` file with your Firebase credentials (already configured!)
- Updated `.gitignore` to prevent `.env` from being pushed to GitHub
- Modified `src/firebase.js` to use environment variables
- Created `.env.example` as a reference for others

### 2. Your API Key is Now Safe!
✅ Your `.env` file will NOT be pushed to GitHub
✅ Only `.env.example` (with placeholders) will be in your repo
✅ Anyone cloning your repo will need to create their own `.env` file

---

## 🔧 IMPORTANT: Restart Your Dev Server

**You MUST restart your development server for the .env changes to take effect:**

1. Stop the current server (Ctrl+C in terminal)
2. Run `npm start` again
3. The app will now use environment variables

## 🐛 Fixing the Blank Page Issue

The blank page when opening shared links is likely due to one of these issues:

### Issue 1: Firebase Realtime Database Not Enabled

**Check if Realtime Database is enabled:**

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Select your project: "girl-math-64fcf"
3. Click "Build" → "Realtime Database" in the left sidebar
4. If you see "Create Database" button, you need to enable it:
   - Click "Create Database"
   - Choose a location (e.g., "us-central1")
   - Start in "Test mode" for now
   - Click "Enable"

5. Once enabled, verify your database URL matches what's in `.env`:
   ```
   REACT_APP_FIREBASE_DATABASE_URL=https://girl-math-64fcf-default-rtdb.firebaseio.com
   ```

### Issue 2: Database Rules

After enabling Realtime Database, set up the rules:

1. Go to "Realtime Database" → "Rules" tab
2. Replace with these rules:

```json
{
  "rules": {
    "shared-stacks": {
      "$stackId": {
        ".read": true,
        ".write": true
      }
    }
  }
}
```

3. Click "Publish"

### Issue 3: Check Browser Console

1. Open the shared link in incognito mode
2. Press F12 to open Developer Tools
3. Check the "Console" tab for error messages
4. Look for errors like:
   - "Permission denied" → Database rules issue
   - "Database not found" → Database not enabled
   - "Invalid configuration" → Wrong database URL

## 🧪 Testing the Fix

### Step 1: Restart Dev Server
```bash
# Stop current server (Ctrl+C)
npm start
```

### Step 2: Create a Test Receipt
1. In your app, create a receipt
2. Fill in all details (subject, items, totals, payer)
3. Click "Calculate Split"
4. Click "Save Receipt"

### Step 3: Share the Stack
1. Navigate to the "Overall Dues" view (swipe right after receipts)
2. Click "📤 Share Stack" button
3. Copy the generated link (e.g., `http://localhost:3000/ABC123`)

### Step 4: Test in Incognito
1. Open an incognito/private browser window
2. Paste the link
3. You should see:
   - The stack name
   - Overall balance calculations
   - All completed receipts
   - "Back to Home" button

## 📊 Debugging Checklist

If the page is still blank, check these in order:

- [ ] Restarted dev server after creating .env
- [ ] Firebase Realtime Database is enabled
- [ ] Database URL in .env is correct
- [ ] Database rules allow read/write
- [ ] Browser console shows no errors
- [ ] Receipt was saved successfully before sharing
- [ ] Share link was copied correctly

---

## 🔍 Check Firebase Console

You can verify data is being saved:

1. Go to Firebase Console → Realtime Database
2. Look under "Data" tab
3. You should see a "shared-stacks" node
4. Under it, you'll see your 6-character share IDs
5. Click to expand and see the saved receipt data

## 🚀 For Vercel Deployment

When deploying to Vercel, you need to add environment variables:

1. Go to your Vercel project settings
2. Navigate to "Environment Variables"
3. Add each variable from your `.env` file:
   - `REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY`
   - `REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN`
   - `REACT_APP_FIREBASE_DATABASE_URL`
   - `REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID`
   - `REACT_APP_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET`
   - `REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID`
   - `REACT_APP_FIREBASE_APP_ID`
4. Redeploy your app

## 💡 Common Issues & Solutions

### "Permission denied" error
**Solution:** Check database rules allow read/write

### Blank page with no errors
**Solution:** Check if database is enabled and URL is correct

### "Failed to load shared receipt"
**Solution:** Verify the share ID exists in Firebase Console

### Environment variables not working
**Solution:** Restart dev server after creating/modifying .env

## 📝 Summary

**What's protected:**
- ✅ `.env` (your actual credentials) - NOT in GitHub
- ✅ API keys are secure

**What's public:**
- ✅ `.env.example` (template with placeholders) - safe to commit
- ✅ `src/firebase.js` (uses environment variables) - safe to commit

**Next steps:**
1. Restart your dev server (`npm start`)
2. Enable Firebase Realtime Database
3. Set database rules
4. Test sharing a receipt
5. Check browser console for errors
