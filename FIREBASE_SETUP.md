# Firebase Setup Guide for Girl Math

This guide will help you set up Firebase for sharing receipt stacks with your friends.

## Step 1: Create a Firebase Project

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Click "Add Project" or "Create a project"
3. Enter a project name (e.g., "girl-math")
4. Disable Google Analytics (optional, not needed for this app)
5. Click "Create project"

## Step 2: Register Your Web App

1. In your Firebase project, click the web icon (</>) to add a web app
2. Give your app a nickname (e.g., "Girl Math Web")
3. Click "Register app"
4. Copy the Firebase configuration object (you'll need this in Step 4)

## Step 3: Enable Realtime Database

1. In the Firebase Console, go to "Build" > "Realtime Database"
2. Click "Create Database"
3. Choose a location closest to you
4. Start in **test mode** for now (we'll secure it later)
5. Click "Enable"

## Step 4: Configure Your App

1. Open `src/firebase.js` in your project
2. Replace the placeholder values with your Firebase configuration:

```javascript
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE",
  authDomain: "your-project-id.firebaseapp.com",
  databaseURL: "https://your-project-id-default-rtdb.firebaseio.com",
  projectId: "your-project-id",
  storageBucket: "your-project-id.appspot.com",
  messagingSenderId: "YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID",
  appId: "YOUR_APP_ID"
};
```

## Step 5: Set Up Database Security Rules

1. Go to "Realtime Database" > "Rules" tab
2. Replace the rules with:

```json
{
  "rules": {
    "shared-stacks": {
      "$stackId": {
        ".read": true,
        ".write": true
      }
    }
  }
}
```

3. Click "Publish"

**Note**: These rules allow anyone to read and write. For production, you should add authentication and more restrictive rules.

## Step 6: Test Your Setup

1. Run your app: `npm start`
2. Create a receipt stack with completed receipts
3. Navigate to the "Overall Dues" view
4. Click the "Share Stack" button
5. Copy the generated link (e.g., `https://girl-math-phi.vercel.app/ABC123`)
6. Open the link in a new incognito window to test

## How It Works

### Sharing Process:
1. When you click "Share Stack", the app:
   - Generates a unique 6-character code (e.g., ABC123)
   - Saves only completed receipts to Firebase under `shared-stacks/ABC123`
   - Returns a URL: `https://your-domain.com/ABC123`

### Viewing Shared Stacks:
1. When someone opens the link:
   - App detects the 6-character code in the URL
   - Loads the stack data from Firebase
   - Displays all receipts and the overall balance in read-only mode
   - Shows a "Back to Home" button

### What Gets Shared:
- Stack name (e.g., "Norcal Trip")
- Stack date
- All completed receipts with their splits
- Overall balance calculations

### What Doesn't Get Shared:
- Incomplete/draft receipts
- Payment status checkboxes
- Edit capabilities

## Troubleshooting

### Error: "Failed to share"
- Make sure you've replaced all placeholder values in `src/firebase.js`
- Check that your Realtime Database is enabled
- Verify your database rules allow writes

### Error: "This shared link is not valid"
- The link may have expired or been deleted
- Check that the database rules allow reads
- Verify the share ID exists in Firebase Console

### Error: "Failed to load shared receipt"
- Check your internet connection
- Verify Firebase configuration is correct
- Check browser console for detailed error messages

## Security Considerations for Production

For production deployment, consider:

1. **Add Authentication**: Require users to sign in before sharing
2. **Restrict Writes**: Only allow the creator to write/update stacks
3. **Add Expiration**: Automatically delete old shared stacks
4. **Rate Limiting**: Prevent abuse by limiting shares per user

Example production rules:
```json
{
  "rules": {
    "shared-stacks": {
      "$stackId": {
        ".read": true,
        ".write": "auth != null && !data.exists()"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Next Steps

Once Firebase is configured:
1. The app will automatically use Firebase for sharing
2. Test sharing with friends
3. Monitor usage in Firebase Console
4. Consider implementing the security improvements above

## Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the browser console for error messages
2. Verify your Firebase configuration
3. Ensure database rules are correct
4. Test with Firebase Console's data viewer

Happy sharing! ðŸŽ‰
